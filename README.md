## GAN for Handwritten Digit Recognition

### Introduction

This project demonstrates the implementation of a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) for recognizing handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset. The GAN architecture consists of a generator and a discriminator network, which are trained collaboratively to generate realistic handwritten digits.

### Getting Started

1. **Prerequisites**
   - Make sure you have Python installed (version 3.6 or later).
   - Install necessary packages using the following command:
     ```
     pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib
     ```

2. **Dataset**
   - The MNIST dataset is used for training the GAN. The dataset is automatically downloaded when running the provided code.

### Usage

1. **Run the Code**
   - Execute the provided Python script (`gan_mnist.py`) to train the GAN on the MNIST dataset.

2. **Training**
   - The GAN will undergo training for a specified number of epochs. Progress and loss information will be displayed during training.

3. **Generated Images**
   - The GAN will generate images after certain intervals, providing a visual representation of the generator's progress.

### Results

- The GAN aims to generate realistic handwritten digits that closely resemble the ones present in the MNIST dataset.
- The generator's progress can be monitored through generated images displayed during training.

### Notes

- Hyperparameters such as the number of epochs, batch size, and latent dimension can be adjusted for fine-tuning.
- Consider exploring advanced GAN architectures, like Wasserstein GANs or Deep Convolutional GANs (DCGANs), for improved stability and performance.

### Acknowledgments

- This implementation is based on the TensorFlow and Keras libraries.
- The MNIST dataset is a product of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and is publicly available for research purposes.
